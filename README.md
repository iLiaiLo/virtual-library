This project represents virtual library.

Only used vanilla javascript to manage books and users.

You can add remove update and display books as well as users.

This project is beginner friendly to understand arrays, functions, objects, control flow, modules, closures and much more.

This project was great experience for me!

I thick it will be helpful for other developers!
